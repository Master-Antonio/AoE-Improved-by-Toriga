Gameplay Mod for Age Of Empire 4 by Toriga

# A message for you
I found a backup of my mod, the mod is now obsolete because I haven't released any updates for over a year and in the meantime Microsoft has updated the game and broken a lot of things, I had tried to quickly update the mod more than a year ago , but I immediately realized that the work would not be easy, because at the time I immediately saw that they had completely changed the structure of the files, for this reason, having no financial support, I decided to concentrate on my real work and my private life, I'm moving away from the game and I don't think I'll get back into it in the future, but lately I've seen a lot of interest from many players, and I thank you, it makes me happy.
For this reason I decided to put my Mod under the AGPL-3.0 license on github, so if there are willing people they can contribute.

# How to contribute
